# An A.I. Pioneer Warns the Tech 'Herd' Is Marching Into a Dead End

Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world's leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.

He was one of three pioneering researchers who [received the Turing Award](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/technology/turing-award-ai.html) , often called "the Nobel Prize of computing," for their work on [the technology](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html) that [is now the foundation for modern A.I.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/technology/ai-openai-musk-page-altman.html) For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.

But after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley's single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development - after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.

The reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won't get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.

"There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing," he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. "It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term."

That critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with [the release of ChatGPT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/technology/ai-chat-bot-chatgpt.html) : Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?
