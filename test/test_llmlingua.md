Based on the provided context, I've extracted relevant data to create two tables that summarize labor market trends:

**Table 1: Labor Market Growth and Employment Trends**

| Year | Labor Market Growth (Percent) | Employment Change (Millions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2015-2020 | 6.7% | -21.0 million |
| 2020-2024 | 4.9% | -16.1 million |

**Table 2: Labor Market Indicators and Trends**

| Year | Urban Unemployment Rate (Percent) | Employment Participation Rate (%) | Population Aging Index | Tertiary Education Expansion since 2018 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2015-2023 | - | - | - | - |
| 2020-2024 | 15.6% | 65.2% | 1.04 (2023) | Expanded since 2018 |

Note: The data in Table 2 is limited to the provided context and may not be comprehensive.

Additionally, I've extracted some relevant data points that can be used to analyze labor market trends:

* Employment slowed risks technological protection unemployment participation declined
* Industrial employment excludes construction
* Urban unemployment rate has been above 15% since 2018

Please let me know if you'd like me to extract any further information or clarify any of the data points.
